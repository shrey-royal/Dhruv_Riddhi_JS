<!-- 

Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code.

Prior to promises events and callback functions were used but they had limited functionalities and created unmanageable code.

let promise = new Promise
