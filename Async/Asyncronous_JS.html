<!-- 
Aynchronous JS
    - JS is single threaded
    - JS is synchronous
    - JS can be non-blocking
    - JS can be asynchronous

Example: 
    - setTimeout()
    - XMLHttpRequest()
    - <script async>
    - <script defer>


here setTimeout() is a function which takes two arguments, first is a function and second is time in milliseconds. 


Tasks: 

Function 1: It will add 4 numbers
Function 2: added number will be multiplied by 2
Function 3: multiplied number will be checked if it is divisible by 10 or not
You can use setTimeout() to make it asynchronous
